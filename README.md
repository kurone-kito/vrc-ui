# ![black.kit.vrcui: Unofficial uGUI theme like the VRChat for VRChat worlds](https://kurone-kito.github.io/vrc-ui/banner.png)

Language: **🇬🇧** | [🇯🇵](https://github.com/kurone-kito/vrc-ui/blob/main/README.ja.md)

VRChat comes with the stress of “learning the world-specific UI”.

We have always wanted to help players who get lost in the different UIs in
different worlds. If we can freely use the same UI within a world as the
standard VRChat one, it may help players and world creators concentrate on
“enjoying the world” rather than “learning or remembering how to operate
the world”.

This “VRCUI” is a VRChat asset created for such creators.
